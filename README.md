Prerequisites
-------------
Extensive installation instructions as well as tutorials and general documentation, including an API reference.
- [Kivy 1.8+](http://kivy.org/#download)

- The FileBrowser widget from the [Kivy garden](http://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.garden.html)


Note:

> **PreSplash Screen**.
> 
> Kivy (actually python-for-android) allows you to set the start screen
> image for your application (so called presplash). But:
> 
> The image size shouldn't be more than max texture size for your device
> (just google to know it, I always take 1024x1024, as much as it's
> supported by the majority of the devices). If it's in png format, it's
> size should be power of 2 (256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024), just like
> good old openGL. Both of these limitations are openGL implementation
> agnonostic, but you never know, if it's good or not. If it's in jpeg
> format (which is actually should be the preferred one), you don't have
> previos limitation, but #1 still counts.

Installation
------------

With the prerequisites installed, you can use the Kivy-Calendear:

    git clone https://github.com/kiok46/Kivy-Calender
    cd Kivy-Calender
    python main.py


On OS X you might need to use `kivy` command instead of `Python` if you are using portable package.

If you're successful, you'll see something like this:
